## Description

This quiz will test your beginner-level knowledge of html, css, javascript! Once you start the quiz, you will have 30 seconds to complete it, if you fail to complete it before the timer ends, the quiz will end automatically with the score you had! If you are able to finish the quiz in time, you will also see your final score. Both situations, you will be able to retake the quiz!

During the quiz, live, you will see after you click your answer, at the bottom it will say right or wrong! Users can keep that in mind so then they can try to figure out the right answers when they retake it until they ace it!

## Usage

With this website, using javascript enabled the ability for a user to select answers then receive data on whether their choice was correct or wrong! This is just the surface level of taking data, saving it, then outputting at the end to show user the outcome of their choices (final score).

## Known Bugs

No bugs at the moment! I was having trouble with bugs within javascript because of renaming certain IDs though! Invalid token errors are too real!
